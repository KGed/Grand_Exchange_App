Basic React-Redux Application which grabs data from the Runescape API and presents it to the user in a table.

This project was just an example project to learn the basics of redux, and basics of working with an API using react. See twitch-clips repo for a more advanced project using react-redux and custom middleware.

To use the application, 

use yarn start

then go to localhost:8080.
